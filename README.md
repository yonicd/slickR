__The last carousel you’ll ever need__

We are happy to bring the [slick](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/) JavaScript library to R. It is self described as "the last carousel you'll ever need". This carousel is based on putting the elements of the carousel in a [div](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_div.asp) HTML tag. This makes the carousel very versatile in what can be placed inside. Regular objects that are placed in a carousel can be for example: images, plots, tables, gifs, videos and objects embedded in iframes.

This tool helps review multiple outputs in an efficient manner and saves much needed space in documents and Shiny applications, while creating a user friendly experience.

These carousels can be used directly from the R console, from RStudio, in Shiny apps and R Markdown documents.
